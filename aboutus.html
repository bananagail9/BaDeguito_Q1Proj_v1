        I am Zyanna Gail P. Deguito, a person with a goal in mind. Ever since when I was little, 
        I always had that empathy and sympathy for the people around me. Though my life at 
        home is chaotic, I will always not let that define who I am and drag me down. For 
        that I have hobbies like crocheting, journaling, painting, playing the guitar, and 
        playing basketball. My favourite food is fruit, and my favourite drink is strawberry 
        latte! I love knowing more about myself and others, making myself and others happy, 
        and loving and taking care of myself! I graduated valedictorian in Harvard University 
        as Psychology as my course, and joined a lot of organizations and movements for mental 
        health. In a darkened world, I want to uncover that light for everyone.

        In the world full of sorrow and worries is a world that needs love, care, hope, and 
        understanding. I grew up in a household where putting importance on mental health is 
        considered overreacting. Whenever I would speak up about my feelings and worries, 
        they would say “Napaka-OA mo naman. Naghahanap ka lang ng palusot.” or “Hoy, 
        sabay-sabay ka masyado ng trend ng world.”, and they would make it worse by insulting 
        me with hurtful words. Growing up in a household where I can't let out what I feel 
        feels suffocating and… depressing. But, I did not let that stop me, and instead, I 
        wanted to fight for what is right, for what we need since the day we were born, 
        especially after knowing that what I experienced, others also experienced.
    </p>

    <p>
        At school, I joined—out of the blue—a friend group that was very toxic and neglectful. 
        At first, I really didn't think much about their corrupted attitude and mindset, 
        but subsequently there were signs of trauma and bad experiences. Instead of thinking bad 
        and focusing on the toxicness about them, I dug deeper on “why”? After time, I realized 
        that they were just broken souls, a kettle that needed that heat and pressure inside 
        of them to stop.
    </p>

    <p>
        One day, I made a way for us to open up, and indeed I was right, they just needed that 
        love and care they needed. From months of unhealthy words and actions, to eventually 
        warming up to each other, having that sense of purpose and goal in mind to be 
        healthy and open, and also help those who were like us before. For that, we named 
        our friend group, Skibigoals, skibidi from our favourite word that makes us motivated 
        and happy, and goals as we have goals in mind everyday. After that, our friend group 
        eventually became an advocacy group trying to let people know that their feelings are 
        valid, how they should think healthy, and how they deserve love and care, too, regardless 
        what gender, age, or status they have.
