    <h1>
        Problems Encountered:
     </h1>
    <p>Did you know that people around the world, including in the Philippines, 
         experience mental health issuesranging from the smallest children to the 
         “toughest” adults? In 2019, 970 million people were suffering from mental 
         health issues (World Health Organization: WHO, 2022). In the Philippines in 2024, 
         there was an estimation of 11.3% to 11.6% of the Filipino population that live 
        in to be suffering internally (Nd, 2024). In ages 10-19, 1 in every 7 of them 
        experiences a mental disorder, and 15% of working adults also experience the 
        same (World Health Organization: WHO, 2024). From 2000 to 2021, rates of suicide 
        in the Philippines have been increasing (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). Studies also 
        show that everyday, approximately 70% of our thoughts are negative (Mo, 2025).
    </p>

    <p>Factors for these issues are not only inborn or genetic, but also things that we can 
        experience in life, like abuse, trauma, neglect, social isolation or loneliness, 
        discrimination, social disadvantage, stress, loss, or pressure that led to the 
        most common mental health disorders, depression, and anxiety (What Causes Mental 
        Health Problems?, n.d.). These problems are also increasing every year 
        (Foulkes & Andrews, 2023). Harassment that is very common in the world, such as 
        domestic abuse, bullying, or sexual harassment, moreover, has an enormous effect 
        on people's mental health (Department of Veterans Affairs (jdt), 2022).

    <h1>
        What Are Done to Address the Problems?
    </h1>

    <p>In the Philippines, there is a lot being done about it, such as the government 
        making Republic Acts addressing the problem. Additionally, people are helping 
        through organizations, and websites are trying to spread awareness and comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
         R.A. 11036 focuses on human rights and focuses on mental health, as it is called 
        the “Mental Health Act”, and R.A. 12080 focuses on the importance of students' 
        and youth's health, and due to that, they should prohibit any action that can 
        damage so (REPUBLIC ACT NO. 12080 - Supreme Court ELibrary, n.d.; Republic Act No. 
         11036, n.d.). Other Republic Acts like 10627 (Anti-Bullying), 9710 
        (Women Human Rights), 11313 (Safe Spaces Act), 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment), 
         and many more help tolerate non-traumatic stressors that cause mental health 
        issues (Republic Act No. 10627, n.d.; Republic Act No. 11313, n.d.; REPUBLIC 
        ACT NO. 7877 - Supreme Court ELibrary, n.d.; Republic Act 9710: The Magna Carta 
         of Women | Philippine Commission on Women, 2009).
     </p>

    <p>
         Organizations in the Philippines like MentalHealthPH and Philippine Mental Health 
        Association, Inc., also support Mental Health (Philippine Mental Health Association, 
        Inc., n.d.; MentalHealthPH, 2023). The Philippines, moreover, hosts events that 
         raise awareness of mental health and launch movements for it.

            Where We Come In:
        </h1>

    <p>Even with all of the big organizations, movements, and laws, here comes this small 
        advocacy group that aims to spread mental health awareness, self-awareness, and 
        loving and caring for yourself and others. Through this website, we aim to 
        publicize and disseminate information about mental health, and provide ways 
         to take care and have a deeper relationship with yourself and people that are 
        good for you. Skibigoals, the heads of Happy Heart, Happy Life, and the Happy 
        Hearts, the community and volunteers and supporters, are disseminating the 
        information, hosting events, counselling sessions on a small scope in homes in 
        communities, students in students, children in orphanages, and patients in hospitals, 
        spreading the light and warmth.

    <h1>
        Call to Action:
    </h1>

    <h3>In a darkened world, together, let's uncover the light.</h3>

    <p>
        What this call to action means is that this world, from the start, deserves that 
        light and warmth—understanding, love, care, hope, and joy, but over time this world 
        covers that truth, and hides away the importance of it. Together, as family and 
        friends, let us take away that cover—from darkness and coldness, to light and warmth.
        Let us spread that light and warmth.
